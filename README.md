TRACULA information and references at https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/Tracula

Contains Freesurfer, FSL, and ANTS. Software versions are specified in the Dockerfile, and can be found in the container in the directory names in `/opt`.

`test-singularity.sh` shows how to create a basic config file for use with preprocessed diffusion images (e.g. from [PreQual](https://github.com/MASILab/PreQual)) and run the full TRACULA pipeline.
